*Why Grappelli?*

From our point of view, the Admin-Interface is one of the most important things for clients/customers and therefore it should just look amazing :-)

We tried to give the Admin-Interface a more "grown-up" and coherent look & feel and added some features.
----
*Why TinyMCE?*

With all the crappy Rich-Text-Editors out there, it´s one of the better ones.
----
*Why are there folders like css and css_grappelli, img and img_grappelli?*

Because, with just one line of code (changing base.css), you are able to switch from the original Django-Theme to Grappelli.
----
*Instead of just changing the original Django Admin-Interface, why is Grappelli not totally build up from scratch?*

Because if there are new features in the Admin-Interface, we are planning to integrate them as fast as possible using Grappelli. Therefore, it heavily relies on the Original Interface.
----
*Who made Grappelli?*

Grappelli is based on the Original Django Admin-Interface by Wilson Miner (http://wilsonminer.com). The Grappelli-Skin is made and maintained by Patrick Kranzlmüller and Axel Swoboda of vonautomatisch (http://vonautomatisch.at).
